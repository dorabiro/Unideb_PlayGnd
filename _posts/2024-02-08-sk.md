I have been working on real measurements and simulations of an active low-pass filter with a Sallen-Key topology. I focused on a specific case of the general Sallen-Key topology, where equal resistor and capacitor values were used: R1 = R2 = R and C1 = C2 = C. Below, I will detail the equipment, results, and methods used.

Equipment Used:
 - Oscilloscope: RIGOL DS1074 Z+
 - Function Generator: RIGOL DG1032Z
 - Power Supply: GWInstek GPD3303S

Components Used:
 - U1 = LM358
 - U2 = OP482
 - R1 = R2 = R4 = R5 = 10kΩ
 - R3 = 1kΩ
 - C1 = C2 = 10nF
 - C3 = C4 = 47uF

Measurement Parameters:
 - Frequency Range: 10 Hz - 10 kHz
 - Signal Waveform: Sinusoidal
 - Output Signal Level: 5 Vpp
 - IC Supply Voltage: ±12 V

Software and Packages Used:
 - KiCAD
 - LTSpice
 - SciLab
 - Python PyVISA-Py
